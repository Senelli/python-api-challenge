## WeatherPy
- called OpenWeatherMap API and got the following data
    - City Name
    - Latitude
    - Longitude
    - Maximum Temperature
    - Humidity
    - Cloudiness
    - Wind Speed
    - Country
    - Date
- a DataFrame was created with the fields described above and exported to a csv file
- created the following scatter plots:
    - Latitude vs. Temperature
    - Latitude vs. Humidity
    - Latitude vs. Cloudiness
    - Latitude vs. Wind Speed
- created a the following scatter plots and calculated/displayed linear regression lineand the r values for each scatter plot listed below:
    - Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
    - Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
    - Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
    - Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
    - Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
    - Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
    - Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
    - Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
## VacationPy
- created a DataFrame with the csv file that was exported in the WeatherPy file
- created a map that displays a point for every city in the DataFrame and the size of the point is the humidity in each city
- narrowed down the DataFrame to certain weather conditions based on the following conditions:
    - max temperature
    - Wind speed
    - Cloudiness
- created a new DataFrame called that has the following information:
    - City
    - Country
    - Longitude
    - Latitude
    - Humidity
- used the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters the each city's coordinates (latitude, longitude)
- Added the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city on the map
